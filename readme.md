# GameCatalogMVC
This tiny sample video games catalog application uses MVC/Razor, Entity Framework Code First, jQuery, Ajax, Bootstrap and Repository Pattern.
There's no need to create any database - a local SQL Server database (.mdf) is included in this project.
Just download it and run the solution, simple as that.
